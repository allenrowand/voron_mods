A modification of the Micron+ bowden tube holder to add an ECAS fitting. I travel my Micron to trade shows in a flight case and need to tuck the PTFE tube into the printer so it doesn't get damaged in shipping. The ECAS fitting holds the tube in place while printing, then I can slide the tube flush with the outside of the back panel for shipping.
